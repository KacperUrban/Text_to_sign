# Text_to_sign

## General info
The project is carring out as part of an engineering project and the "GEST" science club. The main goal is to build model to translation between polish
language and polish sign language. The sign language is represent like a gloss, we don't generate any real signs from data so far. To implement the solution, I use pretrained model from huggingface and fine-tune it. I used a model Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-pl-en.
